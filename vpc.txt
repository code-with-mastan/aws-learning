A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated private network environment in the cloud (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) where you can launch and manage your resources securely.

Think of it as your own customizable data center inside the cloud.

### Key Points about VPC:

* Isolation â†’ Your VPC is separate from others, even though itâ€™s on shared cloud infrastructure.
* Subnets â†’ You divide your VPC into sub-networks (public and private) for better organization and security.
* IP Addressing â†’ You control the IP address range using CIDR blocks (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
* Routing â†’ You define route tables to control traffic flow between subnets, the internet, and other networks.
* Security â†’ You use firewalls (security groups, network ACLs) to control inbound/outbound traffic.
* Connectivity â†’ You can connect your VPC to on-premise networks (via VPN or Direct Connect / Interconnect).
* Internet Access â†’ A public subnet uses an Internet Gateway, while private subnets may use a NAT Gateway for controlled outbound access.

### Example:

* In AWS, itâ€™s called Amazon VPC.
* In GCP, itâ€™s Google VPC (global by default).
* In Azure, itâ€™s the Virtual Network (VNet) (similar concept).

ðŸ‘‰ In short: A VPC is your private cloud network where you run your resources securely with full control over networking.
